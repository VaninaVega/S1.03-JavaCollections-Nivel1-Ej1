#Summary: exercise description

Create a class called Month with an attribute "name" (which will store the name of the month of the year). Add 11 Month objects (each with its own attribute) to an ArrayList, except for the object with the attribute "August". Then, insert it into the place corresponding to that month and show that the ArrayList maintains the correct order.

Convert the ArrayList from the previous exercise to a HashSet and make sure that it does not allow duplicates.

Iterate over the list with a for loop and an iterator.
